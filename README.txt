[Program 1]
[Description]
There are 8 java files: We used Extreme Programming and pair programming that we learned in SWE. Jin drove the most of the code, while Jesse instructed him on what to write. Afterwards, Jesse took over and cleaned up, debugged all of the code. Jin then made test cases for our code. To our program, "javac *.java". To run our program, you need to use "java SecureSystem instructionList".
